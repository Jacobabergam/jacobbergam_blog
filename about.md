I am a process integration and electro-optical engineering leader focused on turning advanced sensor and optical concepts into reliable products. My work sits at the intersection of R&D, manufacturing, and cross-functional execution.

I currently work as a Sr Electro-Optical Systems Engineer at Lockheed Martin, where I contribute to electro-optical system development, cross-functional technical execution, and system-level engineering rigor.

Previously, I led process integration at Atomica and held electro-optical engineering roles at Freedom Photonics and Continental Lidar, supporting high-power laser development, lidar optical architecture, system modeling, and production readiness efforts.

### What I Focus On
- Productization strategy for sensors and optical systems
- Process integration across fabrication, metrology, and test
- Automation and data pipelines that improve technical throughput
- Cross-functional leadership from customer requirements to execution
- Building teams and workflows that make complex programs repeatable

### Background
- BS in Physics, UC Santa Barbara
- Lean Six Sigma Green Belt
- Multiple granted and published patent contributions in lidar and sensor-related technologies
